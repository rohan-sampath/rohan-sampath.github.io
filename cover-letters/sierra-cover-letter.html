    <h1>Dear Sierra Team,</h1>
    
    <p>I'm excited to apply for the Agent PM role at Sierra. As co-founder of <a href="https://coplit.ai">Coplit</a>, I've spent the past four years building and shipping AI-native tools that span conversational agents, voice interfaces, and real-time user interaction — exactly the kind of agent-centric platform Sierra is pioneering.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Deep experience with AI agents</strong></p>
    
    <p>At Coplit, I led the development of multiple AI-native products used by 30+ companies and scaled to ~$1M in ARR. Most relevant to Sierra's agent focus is our memory-augmented semi-autonomous sales AI that integrated across Gmail, Slack, and Salesforce. It maintained long-term user and organizational memory, orchestrated proactive interventions, and ran on a custom control plane with agent orchestration and human-in-the-loop governance. We implemented per-user state tracking and multi-channel deployment to enable autonomous actions inside corporate workflows.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Conversational and voice AI</strong></p>
    
    <p>I also built a real-time voice coaching system that transcribed live sales calls using Whisper and surfaced insights based on BERT embeddings and semantic textual similarity (STS). Designed for high-stakes, live interactions, the system delivered suggestions in under a second so sales reps could act during the conversation.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Enterprise selling & GTM experience</strong></p>
    
    <p>I sold directly to enterprise clients like IBM, Red CS for top accounts, and drove 0 → 1 product work rooted in real-world usage. Our platform supported enterprise-grade requirements: SOC-2 and PII compliance, deep email and CRM integrations, InfoSec reviews, and access controls. I helped architect features like granular permissioning and audit logs to ensure secure deployment. We earned NPS scores in the 70s and were recognized by G2.com as a top-performing mid-market platform.</p>
    
    <p>Before Coplit, I was a McKinsey consultant supporting top tech executives on $100M+ software transformations and $100B+ M&A.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Product leadership</strong></p>
    
    <p>As CEO, I recruited and managed a high-performance team of 10 engineers, 1 designer, 1 PM, and 2 CS reps — fostering a culture of technical rigor, customer obsession, and high ownership. I mentored senior engineers into leadership roles, implemented cross-functional norms around incidents and reliability, and led both product and GTM strategy. I also personally handled enterprise sales, post-sales support, and roadmap alignment based on customer needs.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Technical and product fluency</strong></p>
    
    <p>I hold an M.S. in Computer Science from Stanford (focused on NLP and deep learning) and continue to ship open-source projects — most recently building Langfuse, an open-source observability assistant for LLMs.</p>
