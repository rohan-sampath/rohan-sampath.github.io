    <h1>Dear Sierra Team,</h1>
    
    <p>I'm excited to apply for the Agent PM role at Sierra. As co-founder of <a href="https://www.copilotup.com/">Copilot</a>, I've spent the past four years building and shipping AI-native tools that span conversational agents, voice interfaces, and real-time user interaction — exactly the kind of agent-centric platform Sierra is pioneering.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Deep experience with AI agents</strong></p>
    
    <p>At Copilot, I led the development of multiple AI-native products used by 30+ companies and scaled to ~$1M in ARR. Most relevant to Sierra's agent focus is our memory-augmented semi-autonomous sales agent, embedded across Gmail, Slack, and Salesforce. It maintained long-term user and organizational memory, orchestrated proactive interventions, and ran on a custom control plane with agent orchestration and human-in-the-loop governance. We implemented per-user state tracking and multi-channel deployment to enable autonomous workflows inside complex enterprise environments.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Conversational and voice AI</strong></p>
    
    <p>I also built a real-time voice coaching system that transcribed live sales calls using OpenAI Whisper and surfaced cue cards based on SBERT embeddings and semantic textual similarity (STS). Designed for high-stakes, live interactions, the system delivered suggestions in under a second so sales reps could act during the conversation.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Customer-facing & GTM experience</strong></p>
    
    <p>I sold directly to enterprise clients like IBM, led CS for top accounts, and drove 0 → 1 product work rooted in real-world usage. Our platform supported enterprise-grade requirements: SOC-2 and PII compliance, deep email and CRM integrations, InfoSec reviews, and auditability. I helped architect features like granular permissioning and audit logs to ensure secure deployment. We earned NPS scores in the 70s and were recognized by G2.com as a top-performing mid-market platform.</p>
    
    <p>Before Copilot, I was a McKinsey consultant supporting top tech executives on $10B+ software transformations and $100B+ M&A.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Product leadership</strong></p>
    
    <p>As CEO, I recruited and managed a high-performance team of 10 engineers, 1 designer, 1 PM, and 2 CS reps — fostering a culture of technical rigor, customer obsession, and high ownership. I mentored senior engineers into leadership roles, implemented cross-functional norms around incidents and reliability, and led both product and GTM strategy. I also personally handled enterprise sales, post-sales support, and roadmap alignment based on customer needs.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Technical and product fluency</strong></p>
    
    <p>I hold an M.S. in Computer Science from Stanford (focused on NLP and deep learning) and continue to ship open-source <a href="https://rohansampath.com/projects/">projects</a> – most recently building ScriptForge, an agentic screenwriting assistant for film/TV built with LangGraph. I've also built Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and clients for structured natural language access to complex datasets.</p>
    
    <p>Above all, I'm energized by the chance to work with a high-talent-density team — especially world-class entrepreneurs like Bret Taylor — and contribute to Sierra's mission of making agents the default UI for the enterprise. I'd love to bring intensity, craftsmanship, and deep agent expertise to your team.</p>
    
    <p>Warmly,</p>
